Converts youtube videos/ playlists to audio and downloads them to a specific folder. This program uses multithreading so that you can enter more videos to download while other videos are being downloaded.

## Motivation
I am a long-distance daily commuter, so I wanted to make use of that wasted time. Many recommended podcasts and audiobooks, but there are almost no good podcasts produced with in my native language and the problem with audiobooks is that they require intense focus to keep track of what's happening. Here came the idea to me: amke a youtube downloader that converts videos to audio files and then transfer it to my phone so that I listen to it during my commute.
